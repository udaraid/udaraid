                    UDAR, in elaboration United Development Aid and Relief , is a 100% volunteer-based organization by Bangladeshis in the diaspora for the people of Bangladesh. Our organization was born out of the inspiration we found in the resilience and unity of the Bangladeshi people during recent months. Watching ordinary citizens come together, making sacrifices for the greater good, sparked a deep sense of responsibility within us. Whether it's through emergency relief, long-term development projects, or empowering individuals and communities, we are committed to fostering a future where every Bangladeshi has the opportunity to flourish.
